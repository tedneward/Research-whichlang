"""Judge LLM that maps a raw model response to a single lowercase language token.

We use a cheap small model. The judge never sees which model produced the response,
so it can't bias toward expected defaults.

Returned tokens are normalized to a small canonical set so the report aggregates cleanly
(e.g. "js" → "javascript", "golang" → "go", "py" → "python").
